        <p>Cyberpunk ground defence is a web based 2D local co-op shoot-em-up. You and a friend take control of the cities defence cannons to guard against the incoming
            invasion.
            <br><br>
            You must guard against the invasion to save the city and the residents. The enmies will damage anything they come in contact with, and will eventually destroy the buildings
                of the city. Each building that is destroyed will result in 10K casualties, any enemies that then hit the ground after the building has been destroyed will add
                1K casualties.
            <br><br>
            You will gain points by eliminating the enemies, and can use these points to gain health for you or your partner, gain lives, use special abilites, or save them to 
              win the game.
